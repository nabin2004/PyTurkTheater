# PyTurkTheater
PyTurkTheater is the optional visualization companion for PyTurk. 
It animates forward/backward passes, gradient flows, and optimizer dynamics using Manim. 
This allows you to watch your neural networks in action, step by step.

## Features
- Animate forward and backward passes of MLPs, Residual networks, and Transformers
- Visualize gradient flow, exploding/vanishing gradients, and optimizer steps
- Optional integration with PyTurk — works directly with Value, Layer, and MLP objects
- Export animations to MP4 or GIF for presentations and teaching

# Notes

## Some commands:
```
uv init --python 3.13 project-name
```

```
uv add manim
```
